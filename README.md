# @lit-any/core [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hypermedia-app/lit-any-core/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hypermedia-app/lit-any-core)

Base library for `@lit-any`, a library for building HTML user interafce in a functional style, composed of small,
manageable partial templates.

This package doesn't expose much functionality and it is just a dependency for others which do:

* [`@lit-any/views`](https://github.com/hypermedia-app/lit-any-views) - one way view builder, like React+Redux
* [`@lit-any/forms`](https://github.com/hypermedia-app/lit-any-forms) - forms made simple with lit-html
* [`@lit-any/components-paper-elements`](https://github.com/hypermedia-app/lit-any-components-paper-elements) - form components build to [Material Design](https://meterial.io) using Polymer's original custom elements
* [`@lit-any/components-vaadin`](https://github.com/hypermedia-app/lit-any-components-vaadin) - Vaadin form components
